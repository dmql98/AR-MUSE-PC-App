    description: "This is a Chinese guardian lion. Typically made of stone, they
      are also known as stone lions or shishi (sh\xEDsh\u012B). They are known in
      colloquial English as lion dogs or foo dogs / fu dogs. The concept, which originated
      and became popular in Chinese Buddhism, features a pair of highly stylized
      lions\u2014often one male with a ball which represents the material elements
      and one female with a cub\u2014which represents the element of spirit , were
      thought to protect the building from harmful spiritual influences and harmful
      people that might be a threat. Used in imperial Chinese palaces and tombs,
      the lions subsequently spread to other parts of Asia including Japan (see komainu),
      Korea, Philippines, Tibet, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Cambodia,
      Laos, and Malaysia."
